### KNOWN ISSUES:
- Playback buttons are probably backwards / not matching use
- Proportional scaling has some issues... 
- There's backend functionality for portrait mode, but not used yet
- Playback needs a check to ensure something has been recorded
- Board Buttons need to be redone such that the highlight is seperate
- Board Buttons need a press state

### NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
- Recording
	// Time Display
	
- Playback (board)
